This is a fork of https://github.com/cparse/cparse, with a Qt interface. 

A lot of code has been reoganised and renamed. The Calculator class is still basically the same, and can be called the same. For general use, you can now just include "cparse/cparse.h" now. The startup function is now in this header and is called initialize();
